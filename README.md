# The Slides
### TL;DR [Slides here](https://gangstead.github.io/yarn-unraveled)

To view the slides locally clone this repository, then start a [static http server](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) from that directory.  My preferred way:

```
# one time, to install the dependency
> npm install -g http-server

# start the server in the base directory. -o flag opens browser
> http-server -o
```
