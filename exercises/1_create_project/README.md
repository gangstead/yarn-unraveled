# Create a yarn project.

Let's compare creating a yarn project vs creating an npm project.
- Go to the `npm_proj` directory and execute `npm init`
 - Don't enter anything for name, descriptoin, entry point or test command. Just hit enter.
- Go to the `yarn_proj` directory and execute `yarn init`
 - Don't enter anything for the name, description, or entry point. Just hit enter.
- Compare the output of both files: `cat npm_proj/package.json && cat yarn_proj/package.json`
  - When done you can compare your notes to mine in the file "README_LAST.md"
